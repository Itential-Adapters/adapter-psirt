In addition, it was also found that the original fix was incomplete so new fixed code versions are now available. Please see the <a href=\"#fixed\">Fixed Software</a> section for more information. <br />\n<br />\n<hr />\n<br />\nA vulnerability in the XML parser of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. It was also possible that&nbsp; the ASA could stop processing incoming Virtual Private Network (VPN) authentication requests due to a low memory condition.<br />\n<br />\nThe vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory  when processing a malicious XML payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML packet to a vulnerable interface on an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, cause a reload of the affected device or stop processing of incoming VPN authentication requests.<br />\n<br />\nTo be vulnerable the ASA must have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) services or IKEv2 Remote Access VPN services enabled on an interface. The risk of the vulnerability being exploited also depends on the accessibility of the interface to the attacker. For a comprehensive list of vulnerable ASA features please refer to the table in the  <a href=\"#vulnerable\">Vulnerable Products</a> section.<br />\n<br />\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

      "summary": "Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the OpenSSL package affected by one or more vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, create a denial of service (DoS) condition, or perform a man-in-the-middle attack. On June 5, 2014, the OpenSSL Project released a security advisory detailing seven distinct vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are referenced in this document as follows:<br />\n<ul>\n    <li>SSL/TLS Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability</li>\n    <li>DTLS Recursion Flaw Vulnerability</li>\n    <li>DTLS Invalid Fragment Vulnerability</li>\n    <li>SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability</li>\n    <li>SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS Session Injection or Denial of Service Vulnerability</li>\n    <li>Anonymous ECDH Denial of Service Vulnerability</li>\n    <li>ECDSA NONCE Side-Channel Recovery Attack Vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nPlease note that the devices that are affected by this vulnerability are the devices acting as a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) server terminating SSL or DTLS connections or devices acting as an SSL client initiating an SSL or DTLS connection. Devices that are simply traversed by SSL or DTLS traffic without terminating it are not affected.<br />\n<br />\nCisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. <br />\n<br />\nWorkarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities may be available.<br />\n<br />\nThis advisory is available at the following link:<br />\n<a href=\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140605-openssl\">http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140605-openssl</a>"

      "summary": "\n \n  <p>Cisco Unified CallManager (CUCM) 5.0 has Command Line Interface (CLI)\n\t and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) related vulnerabilities. There are\n\t potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the CLI which may allow an\n\t authenticated administrator to access the base operating system with root\n\t privileges. There is also a buffer overflow vulnerability in the processing of\n\t hostnames contained in a SIP request which may result in arbitrary code\n\t execution or cause a denial of service. These vulnerabilities only affect Cisco\n\t Unified CallManager 5.0. </p> \n  <p>Cisco has made free software available to address these vulnerabilities\n\t for affected customers. There are no workarounds available to mitigate the\n\t effects of these vulnerabilities. </p> \n  <p>This advisory is posted at\n\t <a href=\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20060712-cucm\">http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20060712-cucm</a>.\n\t </p>\n\n\n"
