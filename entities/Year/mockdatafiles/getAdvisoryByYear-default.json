A successful exploit could allow the attacker to pass IPv4 traffic through an unauthenticated ISDN connection for a few seconds, from initial ISDN call setup until PPP authentication fails.</p>\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

      "summary": "A vulnerability in the Raw Socket Transport feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.<br />\n<br />\nThe vulnerability is due to improper parsing of Raw Socket Transport payloads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a TCP session and then sending a malicious TCP segment via IPv4 to an affected device. This cannot be exploited via IPv6, as the Raw Socket Transport feature does not support IPv6 as a network layer protocol.\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

      "summary": "<p>A vulnerability in a CLI command related to the virtualization manager (VMAN) in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system with <em>root </em>privileges.\n</p>\n<p>The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific VMAN CLI command on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system with <em>root </em>privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing specific actions that result in messages being sent to specific operating system log files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available filesystem space on an affected device. This could cause the device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition for clients whose network traffic is transiting the device. Upon reload of the device, the impacted filesystem space is cleared, and the device will return to normal operation. However, continued exploitation of this vulnerability could cause subsequent forced crashes and reloads, which could lead to an extended  DoS condition.</p>\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

      "summary": "<p>On June 3, 2019, SEC Consult, a consulting firm for the areas of cyber and application security, contacted the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) to report the following issues that they found in firmware images for Cisco Small Business 250 Series Switches:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li> Certificates and keys issued to Futurewei Technologies</li>\n    <li>Empty password hashes</li>\n    <li>Unneeded software packages </li>\n    <li>Multiple vulnerabilities in third-party software (TPS) components</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cisco PSIRT investigated each issue, and the following are the investigation results:</p>\n<h4>Certificates and Keys Issued to Futurewei Technologies</h4>\n<p>An X.509 certificate with the corresponding public/private key pair and\nthe corresponding root CA certificate were found in Cisco&nbsp;Small Business 250 Series Switches firmware.&nbsp;SEC Consult calls this the &ldquo;House of Keys.&rdquo; Both certificates are issued to\nthird-party entity Futurewei Technologies, a Huawei subsidiary.</p>\n<p>The certificates and keys in question are part of the Cisco FindIT Network Probe that is bundled with Cisco&nbsp;Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches firmware. These files are part of the OpenDaylight open source package. Their intended use is to test the functionality of software using OpenDaylight routines. The Cisco FindIT team used those certificates and keys for their intended testing purpose during the development of the Cisco&nbsp;FindIT Network Probe; they were never used for live functionality in any shipping version of the product. All shipping versions of the Cisco&nbsp;FindIT Network Probe use dynamically created certificates instead. The inclusion of the certificates and keys from the OpenDaylight open source package in shipping software was an oversight by the Cisco&nbsp;FindIT development team.</p>\n<p>Cisco has removed those certificates and associated keys from FindIT Network Probe software and Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches firmware starting with the releases listed later in this advisory.</p>\n<p><strong>Empty Password Hashes</strong></p>\n<p>The <em>/etc/passwd</em> file included in Cisco&nbsp;Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches firmware has empty password hashes for the users <em>root</em> and <em>user</em>.</p>\n<p>The <em>/etc/passwd</em> file is not consulted during user authentication by Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches firmware. Instead, a dedicated alternate user database is used to authenticate users that log in to either the CLI or the web-based management interface of&nbsp;Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches.</p>\n<p>A potential attacker with access to the base operating system on an affected device could exploit this issue to elevate privileges to the <em>root</em> user. However, Cisco is not currently aware of a way to access the base operating system on these switches.</p>\n<p>Cisco has replaced the empty hashes with hashed, randomly generated passwords during initial boot from Cisco Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches firmware starting with the releases listed later in this advisory.</p>\n<h4>Unneeded Software Packages</h4>\n<p>An attacker who gains access to the CLI of the base operating system may be able to misuse the <em>gdbserver</em> and <em>tcpdump</em> packages that are included in Cisco&nbsp;Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches firmware as part of the base operating system. Cisco is not currently aware of a way to access this part of the system on these switches.</p>\n<p>Cisco has removed the <em>gdbserver</em> and <em>tcpdump</em> packages from Cisco Small Business 250, 350, 350X, and 550X Series Switches firmware starting with the releases listed later in this advisory.</p>\n<a name=\"ap\"></a>"

The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability is due to incomplete role-based access control (RBAC) verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing a specific CLI diagnostic command with crafted user-input parameters. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform an arbitrary read of a file on the device, and the file may contain sensitive information. The attacker needs valid device credentials to exploit this vulnerability.</p></p>\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

      "summary": "<p>A vulnerability in the Cisco&nbsp;Network Plug-and-Play (PnP) agent of Cisco&nbsp;IOS Software and Cisco&nbsp;IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates certificates.

      "summary": "<p>A vulnerability in the 802.1X implementation for Cisco&nbsp;NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN (EAPOL) frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted EAPOL frame to an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Layer 2 (L2) forwarding process to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart of the device and a DoS condition.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Note: </strong>This vulnerability affects only NX-OS devices configured with 802.1X functionality. </p>\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n</p>\n<p>This advisory is available at the following link:<br />\n<a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nx-os-lan-auth\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nx-os-lan-auth</a></p>\nThis advisory is part of the March 2019 Cisco&nbsp;FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 25 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 26 vulnerabilities.

      "summary": "<p>A vulnerability in the network stack of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability is due to an issue with allocating and freeing memory buffers in the network stack. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP streams to an affected device in a sustained way. A successful exploit could cause the network stack of an affected device to run out of available buffers, impairing operations of control plane and management plane protocols, resulting in a DoS condition.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>This vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic that is destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic that transits an affected device.</p>\n<p>Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This advisory is available at the following link:<br />\n<a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-netstack\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-netstack</a><br class=\"t-last-br\" />\n</p>\nThis advisory is part of the March 2019 Cisco&nbsp;FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 25 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 26 vulnerabilities.

      "summary": "<p>Cisco&nbsp;Nexus devices support an automatic provisioning or zero-touch deployment feature called PowerOn Auto Provisioning (POAP). This feature assists in automating the initial deployment and configuration of Nexus switches. POAP is enabled by default and activates on devices that have no startup configuration or when Perpetual POAP has been configured using the <strong>boot poap enable</strong> command.<br />\n<br />\nAs with other automatic provisioning technologies, such as Cisco&nbsp;Zero-Touch Provisioning or Cisco&nbsp;Smart Install, some basic assumptions are made about the initial deployment environment. First, that administrators know that the feature exists and is enabled by default. Second, that the Layer 2 (L2) network on which a device initially connects is secure.<br />\n<br />\nBy design, the POAP feature leverages several unauthenticated protocols to obtain the initial configuration file for a device. When a device with POAP boots and subsequently fails to locate a startup configuration, such as on the first startup after unboxing or after a restoration of factory defaults, the device enters POAP mode. The device will attempt to locate a DHCP server through a connected management interface<sup>1</sup>. Then the switch will listen for a DHCP response that includes at a minimum the following: <br />\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    An IP address</li>\n    <li>A default gateway</li>\n    <li>\n    Option 66 (TFTP server name) or Option 150 (TFTP server address)</li>\n    <li>\n    Option 67 (boot file name)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf the Nexus device receives multiple DHCP responses that meet these requirements, the first DHCP response received will be accepted, and POAP will move to the next stage of the device configuration. If no DHCP responses that meet these requirements are received prior to the timeout period, the device will exit POAP mode.<br />\n<br />\nIf a DHCP response is accepted, the Nexus device will attempt to connect to the provided TFTP server to retrieve the Python or Tool Command Language (Tcl) POAP configuration script specified within the boot file option. The switch will then execute the script to retrieve the specified software and device configuration. The Nexus device software and configuration may be retrieved using Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), FTP, or SFTP. The downloaded Nexus software will be assigned as the active image, with the configuration file scheduled to be applied when the device restarts.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral steps in the POAP configuration process rely on a secure network segment to obtain critical startup information. While the POAP feature disables itself after a configuration<sup> </sup>is applied to a device<sup>2</sup>, it is critical that customers properly secure the networks in which POAP may be utilized. Some customers may want to disable the POAP feature and use other methods to configure a Nexus device out of the box. To this end, Cisco has added multiple new commands to disable POAP that will persist across a reset to factory defaults and the removal of a configuration. For guidelines on securing a POAP environment, as well as information about disabling the feature, see the <a href=\"#Details\">Details</a> and <a href=\"#Recommendations\">Recommendations</a> sections.</p>\nThis advisory is available at the following link:<br />\n<a href=\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-info-poap\">https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-info-poap</a></p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>On some Nexus chassis-based devices, the DHCP solicitation may also be sent using all front-panel Ethernet interfaces of the installed router processor.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup>The POAP feature will not be disabled if Perpetual POAP has been configured using the <strong>boot poap enable</strong> command and will run on each reload of the device.</p>"
